# fortunai

fortunai is a command-line tool that generates AI-powered fortunes. It combines the OpenAI API with the Unix fortune program, delivering witty and insightful fortunes at your fingertips.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gwgundersen/fortunai.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To generate a fortune, simply run the `fortunai` command in your terminal:

```shell
$ fortunai
```

The program will use the OpenAI API to generate a fortune. If the API is unavailable, it falls back to the Unix fortune program.

## Configuration

To use the OpenAI API, you need to provide an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
2. Store your API key in a file named api_key.txt in the root directory of the project.
